# Landsat8-Urban-Fabric-Classification
This project aims to process and analyze land cover data to better understand land use patterns within urban environments. Using the training dataset the Google Earth Engine Community provided, we segment land cover into categories, including buildings, vegetation, and water. We then apply this methodology to several African cities lacking detailed land cover information, utilizing global Landsat 8 data and the Random Forest algorithm for prediction. This project will help urban planners, researchers, and policymakers better understand land cover characteristics in these communities, providing valuable data for future urban development and environmental conservation efforts.
